## Exercise 1: Temperature Conversion

Write a Python program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The program should prompt the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and display the corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit.

To convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can use the following formula:

```
F = (C * 9/5) + 32
```

Write a function called `celsius_to_fahrenheit` that takes a temperature in Celsius as a parameter and returns the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit. Test your function by calling it with different temperature values.

### Example

Input:
```
Enter temperature in Celsius: 25
```

Output:
```
The temperature in Fahrenheit is 77.0
```
