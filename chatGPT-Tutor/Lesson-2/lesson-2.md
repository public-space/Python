## Lesson: Palindrome Checker

In this lesson, we'll learn how to write a Python function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Remove any spaces, punctuation, and convert the string to lowercase to ignore those aspects when checking for a palindrome.
2. Compare the characters from the beginning and end of the string, moving towards the middle.
3. If the characters at the corresponding positions are not the same, return `False`. If we reach the middle without finding any mismatches, return `True`.

### Implementation

Here's an implementation of the `is_palindrome` function:

```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    # Remove spaces, punctuation, and convert to lowercase
    cleaned_string = ''.join(char.lower() for char in string if char.isalnum())
    
    # Compare characters from both ends
    left = 0
    right = len(cleaned_string) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if cleaned_string[left] != cleaned_string[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    return True
```

### Testing

Let's test our function with some example inputs:

```python
string1 = "Able was I, ere I saw Elba"
string2 = "Python is awesome"
string3 = "radar"

print(is_palindrome(string1))  # True
print(is_palindrome(string2))  # False
print(is_palindrome(string3))  # True
```

### Explanation

In the implementation, we use a variable called `cleaned_string` to store the input string without spaces, punctuation, and in lowercase. This is achieved using a list comprehension and the `isalnum()` method to filter out non-alphanumeric characters.

We then compare the characters from the beginning and end of the cleaned string, using two pointers (`left` and `right`). If any characters don't match, we return `False`. If we reach the middle without finding any mismatches, we return `True`.

In the testing phase, we check the function with example strings and observe the expected outputs.
