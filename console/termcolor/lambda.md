Certainly! The line of code you provided demonstrates the use of a lambda function in Python. A lambda function is a small, anonymous function that can be defined in a single line. It is also known as an "anonymous function" because it doesn't have a formal name like a regular function.

In your example, the lambda function is assigned to the variable `print_red_on_cyan`. Let's break down the line of code and explain how it works:

```python
print_red_on_cyan = lambda x: cprint(x, "red", "on_cyan")
```

- `print_red_on_cyan`: This is the name of the variable that holds the lambda function. You can use this variable to call the lambda function later.
- `lambda x:`: This is the lambda function's declaration. It starts with the `lambda` keyword, followed by the argument(s) `x` (in this case, there's only one argument).
- `cprint(x, "red", "on_cyan")`: This is the expression that defines what the lambda function does. In this case, it calls a function `cprint` with three arguments: `x` (the value passed to the lambda function), `"red"` (a string specifying the text color), and `"on_cyan"` (a string specifying the background color).

So, in summary, the lambda function `print_red_on_cyan` takes a single argument `x` and calls the `cprint` function with that argument, along with the specified text and background colors.

Lambda functions are often used for creating short, one-time-use functions or as arguments for higher-order functions that expect a function as a parameter. They provide a convenient way to define functions without the need for a separate `def` statement and function name.
