# Folder Creation Script with Readme Files

This Python script allows you to create a specified number of folders and automatically generate readme files within each folder. Each readme file contains the name of the user and the corresponding date.

## Usage

1. Run the script `create_folders_with_readme.py`.
2. Enter the required information as prompted by the script.

## Functionality

1. Prompt for the number of folders to create: The script will ask you how many folders you want to create.
2. Prompt for folder name: Enter the desired name for the folders you want to create.
3. Prompt for start date: Optionally, you can specify a start date for the readme files. If no date is provided, the current date will be used as the default.
4. Prompt for user name: Enter your name, which will be included in each readme file.
5. Folder creation: The script will create the specified number of folders with the provided name.
6. Readme file creation: Within each folder, a readme file named `readme.md` will be created. The readme file will contain the following information:
   - Name: {user name}
   - Date: {the date}

## Code Explanation

The script utilizes the following Python modules and functions:

- `os`: This module provides a way to interact with the operating system. It is used to create folders, check if folders exist, and join file paths.
- `datetime`: This module supplies classes for working with dates and times. It is used to handle date-related operations, such as getting the current date and formatting dates.
- `input()`: This built-in function is used to prompt the user for input.
- `strptime()`: This method in the `datetime` module is used to convert a string representing a date or time to a corresponding `datetime` object.
- `strftime()`: This method in the `datetime` module is used to format a `datetime` object as a string.

The script follows the following steps:

1. Prompt the user for the number of folders to create.
2. Prompt the user for the desired folder name.
3. Prompt the user for the start date (optional).
4. Prompt the user for their name.
5. Create the specified number of folders using the provided name.
6. For each folder, create a readme file containing the user's name and the corresponding date.
7. Handle any exceptions that may occur during folder creation or readme file creation.
8. Increment the start date by one day for each subsequent folder.


## Error Handling

The script includes error handling to handle potential exceptions that may occur during folder creation and readme file creation. If any errors are encountered, appropriate error messages will be displayed.

Feel free to modify the script to suit your specific requirements or further customize the readme file format.

Happy folder creation!
