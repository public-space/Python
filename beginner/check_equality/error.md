Certainly! I'll guide you through adding error handling to your script step by step. Here's how you can modify your code to include input validation and error handling:

```python
def get_number(prompt):
    while True:
        try:
            number = int(input(prompt))
            return number
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")

def comparison(x, y):
    if x < y:
        print(f"x: {x} is less than y: {y}")
    elif x > y:
        print(f"x: {x} is greater than y: {y}")
    else:
        print(f"x: {x} is equal to y: {y}")

x_input = get_number("Enter a number for x: ")
y_input = get_number("Enter a number for y: ")

comparison(x_input, y_input)
```

# Let's walk through the changes:

1. The `get_number()` function is introduced to handle input validation. It takes a `prompt` parameter that specifies the user prompt.

2. Inside the `get_number()` function, we use a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until a valid integer is entered.

3. The `int(input(prompt))` statement attempts to convert the user input into an integer. If a `ValueError` occurs, indicating that the input cannot be converted to an integer, we catch the exception and print an error message.

4. In the `comparison()` function, we no longer need to handle user input. Instead, it takes the validated numbers `x` and `y` as parameters.

5. Finally, we call the `get_number()` function to obtain the inputs for `x_input` and `y_input` variables, ensuring that the user provides valid integers.

By making these changes, your script now incorporates error handling and input validation for the user inputs. If the user enters an invalid integer, they will be prompted to enter a valid one.
