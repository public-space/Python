Here's an overview of the additional attributes you have included:

- `number`: Represents the number associated with the card.
- `arcana`: Indicates whether the card belongs to the Major Arcana or Minor Arcana.
- `suit`: Represents the suit of the card (e.g., Cups, Swords, Pentacles, Wands).
- `img`: Stores the image associated with the card.
- `fortune_telling`: A list to hold fortune-telling information specific to the card.
- `keywords`: A list to store keywords related to the card.
- `meanings`: A dictionary that holds the meanings of the card, categorized into 'light' and 'shadow'.
- `archetype`: Represents the archetype or symbolic representation of the card.
- `hebrew`: Represents any Hebrew letters or significance associated with the card.
- `element`: Indicates the element associated with the card (e.g., Fire, Water, Air, Earth).

Your code looks good, and you have correctly initialized the attributes in the `__init__` method.

## Full Approach
Yes, you can combine both approaches and have them update each other. Here's a possible approach:

1. Define a Card class:
   - The Card class represents an individual tarot card.
   - It should have attributes that correspond to the information you want to display and manipulate, such as the card name, description, keywords, etc.
   - You can also define methods within the Card class for performing operations or calculations related to the card, if needed.

2. Load data from JSON to create Card objects:
   - Read the JSON file containing the card data.
   - Iterate over the JSON data and create Card objects based on the information in the file.
   - Populate the attributes of each Card object with the corresponding values from the JSON.

3. Store Card objects in a list or dictionary:
   - After creating the Card objects, store them in a data structure like a list or dictionary for easy access and manipulation.
   - This data structure will allow you to perform operations on the cards, such as searching, sorting, or updating specific cards.

4. Update JSON with changes made to Card objects:
   - Whenever you modify a Card object (e.g., update the card's description, add keywords), reflect those changes in the JSON file.
   - You can achieve this by either updating the JSON file directly or by first converting the modified Card objects back into JSON and then rewriting the file.

By combining these steps, you can maintain a synchronized relationship between your Card objects and the JSON file. Whenever you update a Card object, you can update the corresponding entry in the JSON file, and vice versa.

This approach allows you to leverage the benefits of both classes and JSON/dictionary. You can use the classes to represent and manipulate the card objects in a structured and object-oriented manner, while also persisting the data in a JSON file for easy storage and future retrieval.
